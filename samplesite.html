    <p> Earth is the third planet from the Sun and is the largest of
      the terrestrial planets. The Earth is the only planet in our solar
      system not to be named after a Greek or Roman deity. The Earth was
      formed approximately 4.54 billion years ago and is the only known planet
      to support life.</p>
